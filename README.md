- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Ctenberge
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in home automation and safety inside the house. I have several Raspberry Pi's running Domoticz, and also a few ESP8266 and ESP32. One Pi has Z-wave and another RFXcom. Z-wave for control and measure of powerplugs and RFXcom to control 433MHz devices. Also one Pi for Grafana and one for NAS. The ESP's are mostly for measurements and one to control the light in my carport, it switches on if anyone fiddles with my car, the car has an esp8266 inside with a sensor. That esp uses a relais to isolate it from the mains. So that is why I use MQTT on a particular Pi, to send the switch On command. Of course, there is a reset to turn it Off.
